                            Harvest Reformed Church is a church plant that was birthed in March 2024 by the sovereign
                            will of God. We are established right in the heart of Point Cook, a town of great diverse
                            backgrounds, the most diverse multi-cultural township in all of Australia.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We are a small community church who is committed to faithfully preaching and teaching
                            the word of God in a way that speaks into our lives today, as the word of God is intended
                            to.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Faithful biblical preaching and teaching is at the very heart of what we are all about. We
                            believe that the word of God is living and active.
                            <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.esv.org/verses/Hebrews+4:12/#" target="_blank">(Heb 4:12)</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Through expository preaching, we aim to preach the whole counsel of God, without
                            compromise, declaring the good news of Jesus Christ as proclaimed through the Bible in the
                            Old and New Testament.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We know that the fields are ripe for harvest, there are many people who simply do not
                            know the love and grace of God, searching for meaning and purpose in life!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Bible also tells us that there is a labour shortage in the field. We are not commanded
                            to
                            merely get busy in the fields where there is a shortage of labourers, rather, we are
                            commanded to pray to the “Lord of the harvest” that he would send labourers into the field.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This reminds us that we are not to attempt to build a church in our own efforts and
                            strength, for surely it will be unfruitful. We are reminded to pray and to seek God’s
                            direction, for the church belongs to Him alone!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Harvest Reformed Church is a small community with a big heart
                            and a desire to see God glorified in our lives and community.
                            Why not come and join us in worship?

                            Our mission is to be a Bible teaching, Christ-centered church that loves God wholeheartedly
                            and takes seriously our mandate to make disciples of all nations. It is our desire to see
                            spiritual growth in God's people through the power of the Holy Spirit, as we gather together
                            in community for worship.
