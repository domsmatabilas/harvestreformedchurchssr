                        <p>For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according
                            to what he does not have. For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened,
                            but that as a matter of fairness your abundance at the present time should supply their
                            need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that they may be fairness.</p>
