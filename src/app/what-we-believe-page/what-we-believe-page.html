                            As Christians we are committed to the primacy of the Scriptures of the Old and New
                            Testaments as the rule of our faith and of our practice. They are true, authoritative,
                            sufficient
                            and necessary for all of life.

                                Confession of Faith</a> (read in light of the declaratory statement) as our subordinate
                            standard and
                            a helpful summary of our faith and practice.

                        <p class="fst-italic">In short: </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe in the Trinity of the Godhead. There is one God who exists eternally in three
                            Persons - the Father who saves people by drawing them to his Son through the Holy Spirit.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These three are one in power and glory.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe that the Father is the good and loving creator of all that is seen and unseen and
                            he
                            created humanity to rule the world under him.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe in the full divinity and the full humanity of Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of
                            God.
                            He is the fullest and final revelation of God to mankind.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe that Jesus Christ, as the eternal Son of God, graciously became man, lived, died
                            on a cross and rose again to atone for the sins of those who trust Him alone for their
                            salvation.
                            Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and mankind and is ruling at the
                            Father's side now.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe that the Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of
                            judgment;
                            He brings about regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ, indwelling
                            and
                            sealing them for the day of redemption.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe that God's Holy Spirit gives Christians, as they rely on Him, the daily strength
                            and wisdom they need to walk according to His will and to grow in holiness.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe that all people are made in the image of God, but are sinners and are unable to
                            save themselves or even co-operate with God in efforts to earn their salvation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe that the visible church is the gathering of believers around Christ in his word.
                            It is
                            a community of people intended by God to bear witness to him and actively seek the
                            extension of his rule.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe that Jesus Christ shall return personally, visibly and bodily to judge all
                            mankind
                            and to receive His people to Himself.
                        </p>

                        <p class="fst-italic">Furthermore, we believe: </p>
                        <p>
                            We are saved by Grace Alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's God's generosity, and not our own lame attempts to be good or religious or impressive
                            that brings us into his family.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We respond by Faith Alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our response is to rely on the sacrifice of Jesus (his death on the cross), and to keep
                            relying
                            on him to the end. That's all. He does the saving, we do the trusting. That's faith.
                            Our leader and mediator is Christ Alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jesus is the perfect mediator between us and God, and the full and complete sacrifice for
                            our
                            sin. Our leaders direct us to Jesus, not themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are guided by Scripture Alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We don't depend on visions or feelings or traditions or even human reason to know God.
                            Instead we rely on God's revelation of himself in his Word, the bible. That's why we work
                            hard at clear, Christ centred Bible teaching.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The glory belongs to God Alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This follows from all the above. We thank God for saving us, and live out that gratitude
                            giving all our honour, worship and allegiance to him
                        </p>
